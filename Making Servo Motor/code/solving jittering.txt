1. Adding a small delay at startup: When the system powers on, it can help to add a brief delay to stabilize the sensor readings before starting motor control.


Copy code:
void setup() {
  delay(500);  // Allow the system to stabilize for half a second
  // Rest of the setup
}

2.Power Issues and Noise:
Possible Cause: The motor and sensor system may experience power fluctuations, especially when the motor driver (BTS) draws a high current. This can introduce electrical noise and cause incorrect sensor readings.
Solution:
Make sure that the power supply is stable, and the sensor has proper filtering capacitors to deal with electrical noise.
Add decoupling capacitors (e.g., 0.1µF ceramic and 10µF electrolytic) near the AS5600 to reduce noise.
Ensure proper grounding between the sensor, motor, and microcontroller to prevent noise interference.
